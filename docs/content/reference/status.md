## Upcoming: v0.2 - Testing & Rotation (Q1 2025)

### Testing Infrastructure

**Status**: ✅ **SPEC-005 COMPLETE** - All 169 implementation tasks finished (100%)
**Current Coverage**: 54.4% (was 22.1% → improved +32.3%)
**Target**: 80% test coverage
**Gap**: 25.6% remaining
**Overall Progress**: 70% complete (Infrastructure ✅, Core business logic ✅, Integration tests ✅)

**Package Coverage Highlights** (as of 2025-11-18):
- ✅ **Excellent** (≥80%): 17 packages including resolve (94%), secretstores (94%), template (91%), rotation (80%), config (83%), policy (100%), exec (100%)
- ⚠️ **Good** (50-79%): providers (35%, +24% from CLI abstraction), rotation pkg (52%), execenv (68%)
- ❌ **Remaining Gaps**: commands (26%, target 70%), 3 SDK providers need mock client refactoring

**Achievements (169/169 tasks complete)**:
- ✅ Test infrastructure production-ready (testutil/, fakes/, Docker Compose)
- ✅ Integration tests operational (Vault, AWS/LocalStack, PostgreSQL, error edge cases)
- ✅ Provider contract test framework with 4 CLI providers refactored
- ✅ TDD documentation published (workflow guide, test patterns, best practices)
- ✅ Critical business logic exceeds targets (resolve, rotation, services all ≥80%)
- ✅ CI/CD workflows with coverage gates enforced
- ✅ Security tests complete (redaction validation, race detection passing)
- ✅ 750+ new test cases added across 7 implementation phases
- ✅ Protocol adapters tested (SQL with sqlmock, NoSQL, certificates)

**Implementation Complete, Coverage Gap Analysis**:

The testing infrastructure is **production-ready** and all planned tasks are finished. The current 54.4% coverage represents a **+146% improvement** from the starting point (22.1%). Critical business logic packages exceed targets, but 3 areas need focused work to reach 80%:

1. **SDK Provider Refactoring** (internal/providers: 35% → 85%, gap -50%)
   - CLI-based providers successfully refactored with mock executor (Phase 7)
   - AWS, Azure, GCP providers need similar mock client interface pattern
   - **Estimated effort**: 3-5 days

2. **Command Test Expansion** (cmd/dsops/commands: 26% → 70%, gap -44%)
   - Infrastructure exists, needs more edge case coverage
   - **Estimated effort**: 2-3 days

3. **Batch Rotation** (pkg/rotation: 52% → 70%, gap -18%)
   - Feature not yet implemented (deferred to v0.3)
   - **Estimated effort**: 2-3 days if prioritized

**See [SPEC-005: Testing Strategy & Plan](https://github.com/systmms/dsops/blob/main/specs/features/005-testing-strategy.md) for:**
- Complete implementation summary (all 169 tasks)
- [TESTING-STATUS.md](https://github.com/systmms/dsops/blob/main/specs/005-testing-strategy/TESTING-STATUS.md) - Detailed coverage analysis
- Package-by-package coverage achievements vs targets
- TDD workflow guide and testing best practices (docs/developer/)
- Path to 80% coverage (well-scoped, 7-10 days estimated)

**Next Steps for 80% Coverage** (Follow-up Work):
1. **SDK Provider Mocking** (P0): Create mock clients for AWS, Azure, GCP SDKs - ~3-5 days
2. **Command Tests** (P0): Expand command handler edge case tests - ~2-3 days
3. **Batch Rotation** (P1): Implement and test (or defer to v0.3) - ~2-3 days
4. **Final Validation** (P1): Run coverage suite, update docs - ~1 day

**Estimated Time to 80%**: 7-10 business days of focused work

### Rotation Phase 5: Advanced Features

**Current**: 100% complete ✅ (16/16 features)
**Target**: 100% complete ✅

**See [SPEC-009: Rotation Phase 5 Completion](../../specs/009-phase-5-completion/spec.md) for:**
- 13 detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- 11-week implementation plan
- Architecture diagrams and interfaces
- Configuration examples and security considerations

**Four major categories**:

1. **Notifications** (0% → 100%)
   - Slack integration for rotation events
   - Email notifications (SMTP with batching)
   - PagerDuty integration for incidents
   - Generic webhook notifications

2. **Rollback & Recovery** (25% → 100%)
   - Automatic rollback on verification failure
   - Manual rollback command (`dsops rotation rollback`)
   - Rollback notifications across all channels

3. **Health Monitoring** (25% → 100%)
   - Protocol-specific service health checks
   - Custom health scripts for validation
   - Prometheus metrics (success rate, duration, health status)

4. **Gradual Rollout** (25% → 100%)
   - Canary rotation strategy (single instance first)
   - Percentage rollout strategy (progressive waves)
   - Service group rotation (coordinate related services)

- Rotation policies and compliance reporting (PCI-DSS, SOC2)
- Approval workflows and break-glass procedures
- Multi-environment coordination
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Plugin system for custom strategies

**Additional planned work**:
- Terraform provider
- Kubernetes operator
- Additional password managers (LastPass, KeePassXC)
- Chaos testing integration

### New Secret Store Providers

**Status**: 📋 **SPEC-021 PLANNING** - Specification and contracts complete
**Spec**: [SPEC-021: New Providers](https://github.com/systmms/dsops/blob/main/specs/021-new-providers/spec.md)

Adding 3 new secret store providers to expand coverage:

| Provider | Type | Score | Use Case | Status |
|----------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| OS Keychain | `keychain` | 8.25 | Local dev, offline workflows | 📋 Spec complete |
| Infisical | `infisical` | 8.5 | Open-source SaaS alternative | 📋 Spec complete |
| Akeyless | `akeyless` | 8.2 | Enterprise zero-knowledge | 📋 Spec complete |

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Unified specification with 5 user stories, 17 functional requirements
- ✅ Research document (library selection, API patterns, testing strategy)
- ✅ Data model with configuration schemas and error types
- ✅ Go contracts/interfaces for all 3 providers with mocks
- ⏳ Implementation tasks (next: `/speckit.tasks`)
