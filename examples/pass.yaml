# pass Integration Notes:
#
# Setup Requirements:
# 1. Install pass: brew install pass (macOS) or apt install pass (Ubuntu)
# 2. Initialize: pass init your-gpg-key-id
# 3. Add secrets: pass insert dev/database/password
#
# Organization Strategies:
# - Environment-based: dev/, staging/, prod/
# - Service-based: database/, api/, email/
# - Project-based: myapp/, tools/, personal/
#
# Secret Format:
# pass stores the password on the first line, with optional
# additional metadata on subsequent lines:
#
# $ pass show dev/database/config
# MySecretPassword123
# username: admin
# host: localhost
# port: 5432
#
# Advanced Features:
# - Git integration: pass git push/pull for syncing
# - Generate passwords: pass generate dev/new-service 32
# - Edit secrets: pass edit dev/database/password
# - Multi-line secrets: pass insert -m dev/ssl/cert
#
# Security:
# - Secrets are encrypted with GPG
# - Each secret is a separate file
# - Git history provides versioning
# - Access control via GPG key management
#
# Common Patterns:
# - Use hierarchical paths for organization
# - First line is the primary secret (password/token)
# - Additional lines can contain metadata
# - Use consistent naming conventions across teams
