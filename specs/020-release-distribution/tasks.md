# Tasks: Release & Distribution Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/020-release-distribution/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not included - this is DevOps/infrastructure work with manual validation

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US6)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This feature adds files at repository root:
- `.goreleaser.yml` - Release configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Container image
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release automation

External repository:
- `systmms/homebrew-tap` - Homebrew tap (separate GitHub repo)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project preparation and prerequisites

- [x] T001 Create completions directory at repository root: `mkdir -p completions`
- [x] T002 [P] Verify Makefile LDFLAGS work with manual build: `make build && ./bin/dsops --version`
- [ ] T003 [P] Verify existing CI workflow passes on main branch

**Checkpoint**: Project ready for release infrastructure

---

## Phase 2: Foundational - Automated Release on Version Tag (US5, Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable maintainers to release by pushing a version tag

**Independent Test**: Push `v0.0.1-test.1` tag and verify workflow triggers

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This phase MUST complete before US1, US2, US3 can be tested

### Implementation for US5

- [x] T004 [US5] Create GoReleaser configuration at `.goreleaser.yml` with:
  - Project name: dsops
  - Builds for 5 platform/arch combinations (darwin-arm64, darwin-amd64, linux-amd64, linux-arm64, windows-amd64)
  - LDFLAGS for version embedding: `-X main.version={{.Version}} -X main.commit={{.ShortCommit}} -X main.date={{.Date}}`
  - CGO_ENABLED=0 for static binaries
  - See contracts/goreleaser.yaml for reference

- [x] T005 [US5] Configure archive settings in `.goreleaser.yml`:
  - Format: tar.gz for Unix, zip for Windows
  - Name template: `dsops_{{.Version}}_{{.Os}}_{{.Arch}}`
  - Include: LICENSE, README.md, completions/*

- [x] T006 [US5] Configure changelog generation in `.goreleaser.yml`:
  - Use GitHub for changelog source
  - Group by: feat, fix, perf
  - Exclude: docs, test, ci, chore commits

- [x] T007 [US5] Configure checksum generation in `.goreleaser.yml`:
  - Algorithm: sha256
  - Name template: `dsops_{{.Version}}_checksums.txt`

- [x] T008 [US5] Create GitHub Actions release workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
  - Trigger: push tags matching `v*`
  - Permissions: contents:write, packages:write
  - Job 1: Run tests (fail-fast before release)
  - Job 2: Run GoReleaser with GITHUB_TOKEN

- [x] T009 [US5] Add shell completion generation hooks to `.goreleaser.yml`:
  - Post-build hook: generate bash completion to completions/dsops.bash
  - Post-build hook: generate zsh completion to completions/dsops.zsh
  - Post-build hook: generate fish completion to completions/dsops.fish

- [ ] T010 [US5] Test GoReleaser locally with dry-run: `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean`

**Checkpoint**: Push a test tag (v0.0.1-test.1) and verify workflow runs. Binaries should appear in GitHub Releases.

---

## Phase 3: Pre-built Binary Distribution (US2, Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable users to download pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases

**Independent Test**: Download archive from Releases, extract, run `./dsops --version`

**Note**: Most of US2 is already satisfied by US5 (GoReleaser creates the releases)

### Implementation for US2

- [ ] T011 [US2] Verify release archives contain correct files:
  - dsops binary (executable)
  - LICENSE file
  - README.md file
  - completions/ directory with bash, zsh, fish scripts

- [ ] T012 [US2] Test binary download and execution on macOS:
  ```bash
  curl -L <release-url>/dsops_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz -o dsops.tar.gz
  tar -xzf dsops.tar.gz
  ./dsops --version
  ```

- [ ] T013 [P] [US2] Test binary download and execution on Linux (via Docker):
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work ubuntu:22.04 bash -c "
    curl -L <release-url>/dsops_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz -o dsops.tar.gz
    tar -xzf dsops.tar.gz
    ./dsops --version
  "
  ```

**Checkpoint**: Binaries downloadable and executable on all platforms

---

## Phase 4: Checksum Verification (US6, Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable security-conscious users to verify binary integrity

**Independent Test**: Download checksums file, verify with `sha256sum -c`

**Note**: Checksums are auto-generated by GoReleaser (T007)

### Implementation for US6

- [ ] T014 [US6] Verify checksums file is published with release:
  - Check GitHub Release contains `dsops_<version>_checksums.txt`
  - Verify format is compatible with sha256sum

- [ ] T015 [US6] Test checksum verification:
  ```bash
  curl -LO <release-url>/dsops_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
  curl -LO <release-url>/dsops_<version>_checksums.txt
  sha256sum -c dsops_<version>_checksums.txt --ignore-missing
  ```

**Checkpoint**: Checksum verification works for all platform archives

---

## Phase 5: Docker Distribution (US3, Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable running dsops in containers via ghcr.io

**Independent Test**: `docker run --rm ghcr.io/systmms/dsops:latest --version`

### Implementation for US3

- [x] T016 [US3] Create multi-stage Dockerfile at repository root:
  - Stage 1 (builder): golang:1.25-alpine, build static binary
  - Stage 2 (runtime): gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot
  - Copy CA certificates from builder
  - Set WORKDIR=/work for volume mounts
  - Set ENTRYPOINT to dsops binary
  - Add OCI labels (version, source, licenses)
  - See contracts/Dockerfile for reference

- [x] T017 [US3] Test Docker build locally:
  ```bash
  docker build -t dsops:local .
  docker run --rm dsops:local --version
  docker images dsops:local --format "{{.Size}}"  # Verify under 50MB
  ```

- [x] T018 [US3] Add Docker login step to release workflow in `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
  - Use docker/login-action@v3
  - Registry: ghcr.io
  - Username: github.actor
  - Password: secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN

- [x] T019 [US3] Add Docker publishing to GoReleaser in `.goreleaser.yml`:
  - Image templates: ghcr.io/systmms/dsops:{{.Version}}, ghcr.io/systmms/dsops:latest
  - Reference Dockerfile at repository root
  - Add OCI labels via build_flag_templates
  - Skip :latest for pre-releases (skip_push: auto)

- [x] T020 [US3] Add verification job to release workflow:
  - Pull published image
  - Run `--version` to verify
  - Check image size is under 50MB

**Checkpoint**: `docker pull ghcr.io/systmms/dsops:<version>` and run works

---

## Phase 6: Homebrew Distribution (US1, Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable `brew install systmms/tap/dsops` on macOS and Linux

**Independent Test**: `brew install systmms/tap/dsops && dsops --version`

### Implementation for US1

- [x] T021 [US1] Create Homebrew tap repository `systmms/homebrew-tap` on GitHub:
  - Initialize with README.md explaining the tap
  - Create Formula/ directory
  - Set repository to public

- [x] T022 [US1] Create initial Homebrew formula at `systmms/homebrew-tap/Formula/dsops.rb`:
  - Use template from data-model.md
  - Set homepage, description, license
  - Install binary to bin/
  - Install completions to correct locations
  - Add test block: `system "#{bin}/dsops", "--version"`

- [x] T023 [US1] Create Personal Access Token (PAT) for cross-repo access:
  - Scope: repo (for systmms/homebrew-tap)
  - Store as repository secret: HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN

- [x] T024 [US1] Add Homebrew tap configuration to `.goreleaser.yml`:
  - Repository: systmms/homebrew-tap
  - Folder: Formula
  - Token: `{{ .Env.HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
  - Skip for pre-releases (skip_upload: auto)
  - Install block with completion scripts

- [x] T025 [US1] Update release workflow to pass HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN to GoReleaser

- [ ] T026 [US1] Test Homebrew installation after release:
  ```bash
  brew tap systmms/dsops
  brew install dsops
  dsops --version
  brew uninstall dsops
  brew untap systmms/dsops
  ```

**Checkpoint**: `brew install systmms/tap/dsops` works on macOS

---

## Phase 7: go install Verification (US4, Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable `go install github.com/systmms/dsops/cmd/dsops@latest`

**Independent Test**: `go install github.com/systmms/dsops/cmd/dsops@latest && dsops --version`

**Note**: This works automatically once the repository is public

### Implementation for US4

- [ ] T027 [US4] Verify repository is public on GitHub (prerequisite for go install)

- [ ] T028 [US4] Test go install with specific version tag:
  ```bash
  go install github.com/systmms/dsops/cmd/dsops@v0.2.0
  dsops --version
  ```

- [ ] T029 [US4] Test go install with @latest:
  ```bash
  go install github.com/systmms/dsops/cmd/dsops@latest
  dsops --version
  ```

**Checkpoint**: go install works with both @latest and @version

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Documentation and final validation

- [x] T030 [P] Verify docs/content/getting-started/installation.md matches implemented methods
- [ ] T031 [P] Update CONTRIBUTING.md with release process (how to create a release)
- [x] T032 [P] Add developer documentation for release workflow in docs/developer/
- [ ] T036 [P] Add release example in examples/release-workflow.md showing version tagging best practices
- [ ] T033 Create first official release (v0.2.0 or appropriate version)
- [ ] T034 Run full validation from quickstart.md:
  - Test Homebrew install
  - Test binary download
  - Test Docker run
  - Test go install
  - Test checksum verification
- [ ] T035 Update docs/content/reference/status.md to mark SPEC-020 as implemented

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational/US5 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all other user stories
- **US2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on US5 completion (releases must exist)
- **US6 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US5 completion (checksums come from releases)
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US5 completion (Docker builds during release)
- **US1 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US5 completion (Homebrew updated during release)
- **US4 (Phase 7)**: Depends on public repository (external dependency)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being verifiable

### User Story Dependencies

```
US5 (Automated Release) ─────┬─────> US2 (Binary Downloads)
                             │
                             ├─────> US6 (Checksum Verification)
                             │
                             ├─────> US3 (Docker)
                             │
                             └─────> US1 (Homebrew)

US4 (go install) ────────────────> [Requires public repository only]
```

### Within Each Phase

- Configuration files before workflow files
- Local testing before pushing changes
- Workflow must pass before verification tasks

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (after T004-T007):**
- T008 (new workflow file) and T009 (adds to existing .goreleaser.yml) can run sequentially; T009 depends on T004-T007 completing first

**Phase 3:**
- T012 and T013 can run in parallel (different platforms)

**Phase 5:**
- T016-T017 (Dockerfile) can run in parallel with T021-T022 (Homebrew tap) if Phase 2 complete

**Phase 8:**
- T030, T031, T032 can all run in parallel (different documentation files)

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 Configuration

```bash
# After T004-T007 are complete, these can run in parallel:
Task: "T008 [US5] Create GitHub Actions release workflow at .github/workflows/release.yml"
Task: "T009 [US5] Add shell completion generation hooks to .goreleaser.yml"
```

## Parallel Example: Docker and Homebrew Setup

```bash
# Once Phase 2 is complete, these can start in parallel:
Task: "T016 [US3] Create multi-stage Dockerfile at repository root"
Task: "T021 [US1] Create Homebrew tap repository systmms/homebrew-tap on GitHub"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (US5 + US2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational/US5 (Automated Release)
3. Complete Phase 3: US2 (Binary Downloads)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Push test tag, verify binaries appear in GitHub Releases
5. Deploy: This is a usable MVP - users can download binaries!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + US5 (Foundational) → Release automation works
2. Add US2 (Binary Downloads) → Users can download binaries
3. Add US6 (Checksums) → Security verification available
4. Add US3 (Docker) → Container users supported
5. Add US1 (Homebrew) → macOS developers get best experience
6. Add US4 (go install) → Go developers supported
7. Polish → Documentation complete

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum viable release**: Phases 1-3 (Setup + US5 + US2)
- Creates releases automatically on tags
- Provides downloadable binaries for all platforms
- Time estimate: 2-4 hours

**Full feature**: All phases (Setup through Polish)
- All distribution methods working
- Time estimate: 4-8 hours

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- US5 is foundational - enables all other distribution methods
- T010 (local GoReleaser test) is critical before pushing workflow
- T023 (PAT creation) requires repository admin access
- T027 (public repo) is an external dependency beyond this spec
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Test locally before pushing workflow changes
